      <h1>Progressively Enhanced Disclosure (Show/Hide) for Dynamic Content that implements ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1</h1>
      <p>The below example sections demonstrate the design pattern for disclosure. The visual design includes features intended to help users understand that the disclosure provides enhanced keyboard navigation functions.</p>
      <p>Notice that when JavaScript disabled, each section retains an appropriate document structure and the content is completely accessible.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Example 1: The default one. Toggle the visibility of content.</h2>
        <p>A <em>disclosure component</em> is the formal name for the pattern where you click a <code>button</code> to reveal or hide content. This includes things like a <em>"Show more/Show less"</em> interaction for some descriptive text below a YouTube video (for example).</p>
        <div data-aria-disclosure>
          <p>The visual indication of expanded and collapsed states is synchronized with the value of <code>aria-expanded</code> using a CSS attribute selector and <code>:before</code> pseudo element that generates an arrow with the <code>content</code> property.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Example 2: Toggle the visibility of content using an existing <code>button</code> element which is meant to be used as the disclosure controller.</h2>
        <p>This implementation allow you to identify an existing <code>button</code> element as the disclosure controller using its <code>id</code> as value of the <code>data-aria-disclosure-controller</code> attribute, set on the disclosure content.</p>
        <p>Remember that when you choose to use your own <code>button</code> element as triggering element, the reading order in a screen-reader which is based on the order of the HTML elements in the DOM (Document Object Model), has to keep the default tab order.</p>
        <p><button id="dis-trigger" class="button--disclosure">Toggle Content (from this existing <code>button</code> element)</button></p>
        <div data-aria-disclosure data-aria-disclosure-controller="dis-trigger">
          <p>That's why new dynamic content has to be inserted into the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> immediately following the element that was activated to trigger the script. The triggering element must be a <code>button</code> element (natively focusable and activatable).</p>
          <p>Focus remains on the activated element and the new content, inserted after it, becomes the next thing in both the tab order and screen-reader reading order. This implementation is necessary to meet the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order">2.4.3: Focus Order</a> criterion.</p>
